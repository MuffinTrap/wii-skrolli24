### Rocket library

(Original library)[https://github.com/rocket/rocket]

This is a modified version of the rocket library
that can write tracks to a header and cpp files.

It cannot be installed as a library since
you need to compile it as a part of your project
depending whether the project will be connected
to a rocket editor or not.

When developing the project you connect to the editor
and adjust the values.
When releasing the project you need to compile with
SYNC_PLAYER

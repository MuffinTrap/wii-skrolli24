Background:
I got an idea of making a demo featuring the melancholy of the part in Life is Strange game, where Max goes to the alternative timeline where Chloe is disabled by a car crash. Max wished everything to stay the same as in their childhood but when she meets Chloe and visits her old room, it is all changed.

I cut together a video showing the idea: you can see it here in YouTube.

Later in the progress, when thinking about a name for the demo I found this word in the Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows, that captured the feeling I was going after.

"keir"
n. an ill-fated attempt to reenact a beloved memory years later, returning to a place that once felt like home, only to find it now feels uncannily off, like walking through a wax museum of your own childhood.

We did have original music made by Vurpo, but no time to sync the demo to it so the placeholder music was kept. You can visit the artist's Jamendo page here:
